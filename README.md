## 🎯 The Problem
One of the most common challenges in the pharmaceutical supply chain is inventory distortion — the imbalance between overstocking and understocking. 

For a typical retail business, a stockout means a lost sale. In the pharmaceutical industry, the stakes are infinitely higher — it can mean a delay in life-saving treatment. This immense responsibility is why effective pharmacy inventory forecasting is not just a good business practice, but a critical component of patient safety.

## 💡 Key Insights

-  Paracetamol drives 49.4% of total sales  
-  Annual seasonality is strong  
-  Weekly seasonality is negligible  
-  Saturday is the busiest day  
-  Linear Regression performed nearly as well as Random Forest

## 📊 The Dataset


The model was trained on a pharmacy sales dataset obtained from Kaggle, containing historical transactional sales records from 2014–2019. 


### Getting the Data

The dataset is not included in this repository. To set it up locally:

**Option 1 — Download manually (recommended)**

1. Go to [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/milanzdravkovic/pharma-sales-data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/milanzdravkovic/pharma-sales-data)
2. Click **Download**
3. Extract and place `salesdaily.csv` at:

```
PharmaCast/data/pharma-sales-data/salesdaily.csv
```

The notebook reads the file from this path. No other configuration is needed.

**Option 2 — Download via kagglehub**

```bash
pip install kagglehub
```

```python
import kagglehub
from kagglehub import KaggleDatasetAdapter

df = kagglehub.load_dataset(
    KaggleDatasetAdapter.PANDAS,
    "milanzdravkovic/pharma-sales-data",
    ""
)
```

> A Kaggle account and configured API token are required for Option 2.  
> See [Kaggle API setup](https://github.com/Kaggle/kagglehub) for instructions.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anaboset/FUTURE_ML_01
cd FUTURE_ML_01
```

**2. Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Add the dataset**

Download `salesdaily.csv` from Kaggle and place it at `data/pharma-sales-data/salesdaily.csv`.  
See [Getting the Data](#getting-the-data) above for full instructions.

**4. Create the outputs folder**
```bash
mkdir outputs
```

**5. Run the notebook**
```bash
jupyter notebook pharma_sales_forecast.ipynb
```

Run all cells from top to bottom. Each chapter builds on the previous one.

## ⚠️ Limitations 

- Cannot predict external outbreaks/events
- Requires historical sales data
- Large unexplained spikes still affect accuracy
- Retraining needed monthly

## 👤 Author's Note

If the forecast helps a single pharmacy avoid a stockout on a critical medication, the project has achieved its purpose.
